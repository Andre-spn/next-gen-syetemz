## Purpose of the Program:
The **Course Registration and Payment System** is a Python-based application developed as part of the ITT103 course project. It allows students to register for courses and manage their payments efficiently. The program incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, modular design, and exception handling to provide a robust and user-friendly experience.

---

## How to Run the Program:
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed on your system.
   - Install any required modules specified in the `requirements.txt` file (if applicable).

2. **Steps to Run:**
   -      ```
   -copy program below and run in python console
     ```
    

3. **User Interaction:**
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to:
     - Register for courses.
     - View registered courses.
     - Process payments.

4. **System Demonstration:**
   -The program allows you to input information and see how it works
---

## Program Modifications:
1. **Version 1.0:**
   - Initial implementation of the Course Registration system.
   - Features:
     - User authentication.
     - Course selection and registration.
     - Basic payment functionality.

2. **Version 1.1:**
   - Added input validation and exception handling for improved user experience.
   - Enhanced error messages and edge case handling.

3. **Version 1.2:**
   - Introduced modular functions for better code readability and maintenance.
   - Implemented course limits (e.g., maximum number of students per course).

4. **Version 1.3:**
   - Integrated payment confirmation and receipt generation.
   - Updated user interface for enhanced interaction.

---

## Assumptions and Limitations:
1. **Assumptions:**
   - Users will enter valid inputs (e.g., no special characters in names).
   - Payments are processed as direct input (no actual payment gateway is used).

2. **Limitations:**
   - The program is designed for demonstration purposes and does not support concurrent user access.
   - No real-time database integration; data is stored in memory.
